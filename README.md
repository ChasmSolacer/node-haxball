- Utils: Some static utility functions.

  - generateAuthKey(): generates a new player_auth_key. you should store it and use it later if you want to be recognized in Haxball rooms. (use it in Haxball _constructor_) (returns Promise(CryptoKeyPair))
  - getRoomList(): returns the current room list. (returns Promise(roomListArray))
  - keyState(dirX, dirY, kick): returns an integer keyState value to be used in Room.setKeyState. dirX = oneof\[-1:left, 0:still, 1:right\], dirY = oneof\[-1:up, 0:still, 1:down\], kick = true/false.

- Haxball: Main client class.

  - constructor(object): creates a new instance of Haxball client with storage values in parameter _object_ set accordingly. values for only these keys of _object_ will be used: \['show_indicators','player_name','fps_limit','player_auth_key','sound_chat','show_avatars','geo','geo_override','sound_crowd','sound_highlight','sound_main','extrapolation','avatar','resolution_scale','view_mode','player_keys','team_colors'\]. _render_ is a special key that is used mostly for rendering purposes. it may have values for these browser environment(window) function/variables: 'setTimeout', 'clearTimeout', 'setInterval', 'clearInterval', 'performance', 'console', 'requestAnimationFrame', 'cancelAnimationFrame', 'crypto', 'renderer'. the functions(_setTimeout_, _clearTimeout_, _setInterval_, _clearInterval_, _requestAnimationFrame_, _cancelAnimationFrame_) should be binded to browser's _window_ object.

  - properties:
    - version: current version number. other clients cannot join the room created by this Haxball client if this version number is different than theirs.

  - functions:
    - value = getStorageValue(key): returns the current value of storage\[key\] where key must be one of \['show_indicators','player_name','fps_limit','player_auth_key','sound_chat','show_avatars','geo','geo_override','sound_crowd','sound_highlight','sound_main','extrapolation','avatar','resolution_scale','view_mode','player_keys','team_colors'\].
    - setStorageValue(key, value): sets storage\[key\]=(value) where key must be one of \['show_indicators','player_name','fps_limit','player_auth_key','sound_chat','show_avatars','geo','geo_override','sound_crowd','sound_highlight','sound_main','extrapolation','avatar','resolution_scale','view_mode','player_keys','team_colors'\].
    - createRoom({name, password, maxPlayerCount, showInRoomList, token, geo, playerCount, unlimitPlayerCount, fakePassword, kickTimeout, plugins}): create a room with given parameters. Must leave current room first. returns Promise(room) which is rejected if failed.
    - joinRoom({roomId, password, token, kickTimeout, plugins}): try to join the room(roomId) with given password(or null=no password). Must leave current room first. returns Promise(room) which is rejected if failed.
    - leaveRoom(): Leave current room. Must be in a room.
    - setRenderer(renderer): sets the renderer object that will render the game. The object should follow the provided Renderer template.
    - isCustomVersion(): returns whether the version number is the same as the original client. 
    - setCustomVersion(custom): if custom=true, sets the version number to a specific value(always using the same for recognition); otherwise sets it to the same as the original client. Set it to true if you want your room to be inaccessible to people using the original client.

  - internally used events: 
    - connectionStateChange(state): triggered several times while joining a room. use ConnectionState\[state\] for explanation on returned value.
    - joinRoomSucceeded(): triggered only once when join room succeeds and just before Room object is created and Promise is resolved.
    - createRoomSucceeded(): triggered only once when create room succeeds and just before Room object is created and Promise is resolved.
    - roomLeave(): triggered only once while leaving the room by any means.

  - other events:
    - joinRoomFailed(error): join room failed with error(error).
    - ready(): haxball api has just become ready to work.
    - roomJoin(room): joined/created room.
    - joinRoomReverse(): trying reverse connection while joining a room.
    - RequestRecaptcha(): recaptcha is required while joining or creating a room.

  - events to be triggered by user:
    - cancelJoinRoom(): trigger to cancel joining a room.
    - RecaptchaToken(token): trigger to send the recaptcha token after RequestRecaptcha event occurred. currently only working for creating a room. workaround: in order to send the token to try and join a recaptcha-protected room, cleanup old resources/handlers and use Haxball.joinRoom with the new token.

- Room: The class that hosts all room operations. Should only be initialized from inside the Haxball client class and retrieved from a resolved Promise resulting from either Haxball.createRoom or Haxball.joinRoom.

  - properties:
    - isHost: true for hosts, false for clients
    - client: a reference to the Haxball client object that created this Room object
    - currentPlayerId: current player's id
    - currentPlayer: the original current player object
    - sdp: current room's sdp value (only for client rooms)
    - kickTimeout: time between releasing and re-pressing the kick key (in milliseconds, defaults to 20)
    - plugins: array of all available plugins. this is used internally to restore the order of plugins while plugin activation/deactivation.
    - activePlugins: array of currently active plugins. this is used internally for callbacks.
    - pluginsMap: all available plugins mapped as pluginsMap\[plugin.name\] = plugin, for optimized use to communicate between plugins.
